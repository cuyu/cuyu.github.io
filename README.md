### CLI

I've write a python script to generate new mark down file and with some other convenient functions.

#### Prerequisites

To enable the `argcomplete`, you should:

1. ```bash
   pip install argcomplete
   ```

2. Insert the following content into `~/.zshrc`:

   ```bash
   eval "$(register-python-argcomplete blogging)"
   ```

To using `blogging` command from anywhere, you should:

1. Create a soft link to the `blogging` file:

   ```
   ln -s [YOUR_PROJECT_PATH]/blogging /usr/bin/local/blogging
   ```

2. Set the blog project path:

   ```
   blogging set-project-path [YOUR_PROJECT_PATH]
   ```

Open a new shell session and ENJOYüçπ

#### Usage

```
blogging new {title} {category} {tag1} {tag2}
```

This will generate a new file (under `./_drafts/`) with some meta data and open it.

```
blogging ls category
```

This will list all the categories and corresponding count.

```
blogging ls tag
```

The same but list tags instead.

```
blogging save
```

This will commit in all the changes in `./_drafts/` folder.

```
blogging publish {file_name}
```

This will move the file from `./_drafts/` to `./_posts/` (also change the date info) and commit it to the Github pages.

### TODO List

#### For the site:

- ~~Add visit statistics~~
- ~~Add tags for article~~
- ~~Add message board~~
- ~~Display the summary of the articles on main page intead of the whole articles~~
- Randomly changed background image
- Add license
- ~~Add about page~~
- ~~Complete sidebar~~
- More cool animation
- ~~A playground page to display some front-end cool staff~~
- *A side bar to display footnotes
  *Seems a little bit difficult to implement as Github disables customize Jekyll plugins. Although we can use Javascript to relocate footnotes after Jekyll rendered, the footnote cannot contain multi-lines. All these (limitations) make it complicated to achieve a notebook-like page layout.*
- In site content search (can use google)
- A statistics page (e.g. the rank of each post viewed/commented, the average word count, etc.)
- Besides create date, display edit date (if the post is edited later)

#### For CLI:

- Can push specific post to git and there can be a post time besides a create time
- ~~Auto complete category/tags~~
- Colourful
