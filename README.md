This is my personal blog.

### CLI

I've write a python script to generate new mark down file and some other convenient functions:

```
./blogging new {title} {category} {[tag1, tag2]}
```

This will generate a new file with some meta data and open it.

```
./blogging ls category
```

This will list all the categories and corresponding count.

```
./blogging ls tag
```

The same but list tags instead.
