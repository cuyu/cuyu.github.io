1. Web service worker is by default enabled in the project created by latest `create-react-app`. However, `npm start` do not enable web service workers (for better dev experience as no cache). Instead, you should (`npm install -g serve` if cmd serve not installed):

   ```
   npm run build
   serve -T -s build
   ```

2. To solve the following error when testing the app locally:

   ```
   DOMException: Failed to register a ServiceWorker: An SSL certificate error occurred when fetching the script
   ```

   Please open the chrome with extra options, e.g.

   ```
   /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --ignore-certificate-errors --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure=https://localhost:5000 --user-data-dir=/tmp/foo
   ```

3. You can view the PWA status (e.g. the data stored in Local Storage/IndexedDB) by Chrome dev console (the Application tab);

4. You can evaluate your PWA by Google lighthouse tool which is also availiable by Chrome dev console (the Audits tab);

5. Use library like [pouchDB](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb) to save your app state into local computer storage, so that your PWA can work offline as normal.
