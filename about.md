### About this site

This site is developed based on `Jekyll 3` and powered by [lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/). Here are some plugins and third-party services I used:

- `rouge` — A Jekyll plugin to display code blocks with colours
- `jekyll-paginate` — A Jekyll plugin to display articles with multiple pages conveniently
- [不蒜子](http://ibruce.info/2015/04/04/busuanzi/) — A third-party service to record the site and article visit statistics
- [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) — A third-party service to provide comment function
